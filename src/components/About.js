                I enjoy short walks on the beach with a pipin hot cup of the finest coffee in one hand, and with my shoes in the other. 
                I just love how the sand feels on my socks while I'm burning up from the warm weather and the poor choice of drink.
                I would love to bring my son out to the beach but he's more fond of the indoors, 
                and the outdoors tend to be too dangerous for the little bugger.
                Oh I also write software sometimes. Please hire me. <br/> <br/>
                (I will write something more serious when I'm closer to being done with this. Hopefully nobody sees this before then ðŸ¤«)
